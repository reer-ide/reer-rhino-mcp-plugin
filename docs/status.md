# REER Rhino MCP Plugin Development Scratchpad

This document keeps track of development tasks, notes, and progress for the REER Rhino MCP Plugin.

## Current Implementation Plan: Basic Structure

### Phase 1: Core Interfaces and Structure (CURRENT)

**1. Directory Structure Setup**
- [x] Create directory structure following the implementation guide
- [x] Set up basic namespaces and organization

**2. Common Interfaces**
- [x] `IRhinoMCPConnection`: Common interface for both connection types
- [x] `ICommandHandler`: Interface for MCP command handlers (will be needed later)
- [x] `IConnectionManager`: Interface for managing connections
- [x] Event argument classes for command handling

**3. Configuration System**
- [x] `ConnectionMode` enum (Local, Remote)
- [x] `ConnectionSettings` class for storing connection parameters
- [x] `RhinoMCPSettings` class for persistent settings storage
- [x] Settings serialization/deserialization

**4. Connection Manager**
- [x] `RhinoMCPConnectionManager`: Central coordinator
- [x] Connection state management
- [x] Mode switching logic (ensuring only one active connection)
- [x] Event handling for connection status changes

**5. Basic Plugin Structure**
- [x] Update main plugin class to initialize connection manager
- [x] Plugin lifecycle management (start/stop/cleanup)
- [x] Error handling and logging framework

**6. Command Framework**
- [x] Base command handler structure (placeholder implementations)
- [ ] Command routing mechanism (will implement with actual MCP commands)
- [ ] Response formatting utilities

### Implementation Status:
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Basic structure and interfaces are in place
‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Project builds successfully for .NET 4.8 (Rhino target)
üöß **NEXT**: Implement actual TCP server functionality

### Build Status:
- ‚úÖ All core interfaces implemented
- ‚úÖ Connection manager working
- ‚úÖ Plugin lifecycle management working
- ‚úÖ Settings system implemented (using plugin.Settings API)
- ‚úÖ Project compiles successfully for Rhino (.NET 4.8)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some warnings about unused async methods (expected for placeholder implementations)

### Notes:
- Placeholder implementations created for RhinoMCPServer and RhinoMCPClient
- Main plugin integrates connection manager properly
- Settings system uses Rhino's plugin.Settings API instead of ApplicationSettings
- Added Newtonsoft.Json package reference for JSON handling
- Excluded DesignDocs from build to avoid conflicts with reference implementations
