# REER Rhino MCP Plugin Development Status

This document tracks the development roadmap and progress for the REER Rhino MCP Plugin.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **Project Setup**: Implemented the core directory structure, namespaces, and project configurations.
- [x] **Core Interfaces**: Defined `IRhinoMCPConnection`, `IConnectionManager`, and event argument classes.
- [x] **Configuration System**: Created `RhinoMCPSettings` for persistent settings management.
- [x] **Connection Manager**: Built the `RhinoMCPConnectionManager` to handle connection state.
- [x] **Plugin Integration**: Integrated the manager into the main plugin lifecycle.
- [x] **VS Code Debugging**: Fixed and configured `.vscode/launch.json` and `.vscode/tasks.json` for a smooth debugging experience.

### Phase 2: Local Server and Command Interface ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] **TCP Server**: Implemented the `RhinoMCPServer` for handling local connections.
- [x] **Command Interface**: Created the interactive `RhinoReer` command (`local_start`, `stop`, `status`).
- [x] **Test Client**: Updated `test_client.py` to align with the new command-driven workflow.
- [x] **Documentation**: Updated all relevant documents with the new workflow and command structure.

### Phase 3: Resource Monitoring and MCP Resources üöß NEXT
- [ ] **Resource Monitoring Service**:
    - [ ] Implement a service to hook into Rhino events (`BeginCommand`, `AddRhinoObject`, etc.).
    - [ ] Subscribe to events in a thread-safe manner.
- [ ] **MCP Resource Data**:
    - [ ] Define the data structures for `command_history` and `document_metadata`.
    - [ ] Implement logic to populate these structures from Rhino events.
- [ ] **Expose Resources**:
    - [ ] Add an endpoint to `RhinoMCPServer` to expose these resources via MCP.
    - [ ] Implement basic query support for the resources.

### Phase 4: User Interface and First-Time Setup üóìÔ∏è FUTURE
- [ ] **Settings Dialog**:
    - [ ] Create an Eto-based UI dialog for connection settings.
    - [ ] Implement logic to show the dialog on the first run.
- [ ] **Command Integration**: Add a `configure` option to the `RhinoReer` command to open the dialog manually.
- [ ] **Refine Settings**: Improve the `RhinoMCPSettings` class to handle both local and remote configurations from the UI.

### Phase 5: Remote Client and Authentication üóìÔ∏è FUTURE
- [ ] **WebSocket Client**: Implement the `RhinoMCPClient` for connecting to a remote MCP server.
- [ ] **Authentication**: Add token-based authentication for the remote connection.
- [ ] **Remote Mode UI**: Integrate remote settings into the configuration dialog.

## Build Status
- ‚úÖ Compiles successfully for .NET 4.8 and .NET 7.0
- ‚úÖ VS Code debugging working (both netcore and netfx configurations)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected warnings for placeholder WebSocket client implementation.
