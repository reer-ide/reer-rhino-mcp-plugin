# Project Overview

This project is a Rhino plugin that implements the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to enable communication between Rhino and AI assistants like Claude. The plugin replaces the previous Python script-based approach with a native Rhino plugin for better integration and user experience.

## Key Files

- [ReerRhinoMCPPlugin.cs](mdc:ReerRhinoMCPPlugin.cs): The main plugin class that initializes the plugin
- [rhino_mcp_Command.cs](mdc:rhino_mcp_Command.cs): Initial command template to be expanded for MCP commands

## Implementation Approach

The plugin implements a TCP socket server that listens for MCP commands from clients like Claude Desktop. It then executes these commands in Rhino and returns the results back to the client.

The project structure will include:
- Socket server implementation
- Command handlers for MCP protocol
- Serialization utilities for Rhino objects
- UI for plugin configuration

## Development Roadmap

The development roadmap is detailed in [.cursor/scratchpad.md](mdc:.cursor/scratchpad.md), which outlines the phases and tasks for completing the plugin.
