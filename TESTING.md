# Testing the RhinoMCP TCP Server Implementation

This document describes how to test the newly implemented TCP server functionality for the REER Rhino MCP Plugin.

## What's Been Implemented

### Phase 1 Complete: Core TCP Server Infrastructure

✅ **Core Architecture**
- `IRhinoMCPConnection` interface for unified connection handling
- `IConnectionManager` for managing single active connections
- `ConnectionSettings` with validation for local/remote modes
- Thread-safe connection management with proper cleanup

✅ **TCP Server Implementation** (`RhinoMCPServer`)
- Full TCP listener with async/await pattern
- Multi-client connection support with individual client management
- Proper JSON message parsing and error handling
- Thread-safe client collection management
- Graceful shutdown and resource cleanup

✅ **Client Connection Management** (`ClientConnection`)
- Individual client connection handling
- Async message processing with cancellation support
- JSON command parsing with error responses
- Automatic client cleanup on disconnection

✅ **Basic Command Processing** (`BasicCommandHandler`)
- MCP protocol command routing
- Built-in test commands: `ping`, `get_rhino_info`, `get_document_info`
- Proper JSON response formatting with success/error status
- Integration with Rhino document API

✅ **Plugin Integration**
- Settings persistence using Rhino's plugin settings API
- Auto-start capability
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling
- Proper plugin lifecycle management

✅ **Rhino Command Interface** (`RhinoMCPCommand`)
- Interactive command to start/stop the server
- Status display and server management
- User-friendly prompts for server control

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Build the Plugin

```bash
dotnet build
```

The plugin will be built to:
- `bin/Debug/net48/rhino_mcp_plugin.rhp` (for Rhino 7/8 on Windows)
- `bin/Debug/net7.0/rhino_mcp_plugin.rhp` (for Rhino 8 cross-platform)

### 2. Install in Rhino

1. Copy the appropriate `.rhp` file to a location accessible by Rhino
2. In Rhino, run the `PlugInManager` command
3. Click "Install..." and select the `.rhp` file
4. Restart Rhino if prompted

### 3. Start the MCP Server

In Rhino's command line, type:
```
RhinoMCP
```

When prompted, type `start` to start the server. You should see:
```
Starting MCP server...
MCP server started successfully on 127.0.0.1:1999
You can now test it with the Python test client: python test_client.py
```

### 4. Test with Python Client

Run the included test client:
```bash
python test_client.py
```

Expected output:
```
Rhino MCP Plugin Test Client
========================================
Connecting to Rhino MCP server at 127.0.0.1:1999...
Connected successfully!

--- Test 1: ping ---
Sending: {"type": "ping", "params": {}}
Received: {"status": "success", "result": {"message": "pong"}}
Status: success
Result: {
  "message": "pong"
}

--- Test 2: get_rhino_info ---
Sending: {"type": "get_rhino_info", "params": {}}
Received: {"status": "success", "result": {"rhino_version": "8.0.23304.9001", ...}}
Status: success
Result: {
  "rhino_version": "8.0.23304.9001",
  "build_date": "2023-10-31",
  "plugin_name": "REER Rhino MCP Plugin",
  "plugin_version": "1.0.0"
}

--- Test 3: get_document_info ---
Sending: {"type": "get_document_info", "params": {}}
Received: {"status": "success", "result": {"document_name": "Untitled", ...}}
Status: success

--- Test 4: unknown_command ---
Sending: {"type": "unknown_command", "params": {}}
Received: {"status": "error", "message": "Unknown command type: unknown_command"}
Status: error
Message: Unknown command type: unknown_command

--- All tests completed ---

Test completed successfully!
```

### 5. Test with Manual TCP Connection

You can also test manually using telnet or netcat:

```bash
# Using telnet (Windows)
telnet 127.0.0.1 1999

# Using netcat (Linux/Mac)
nc 127.0.0.1 1999
```

Then send JSON commands:
```json
{"type": "ping", "params": {}}
```

### 6. Stop the Server

In Rhino, run `RhinoMCP` again and type `stop` when prompted.

## Architecture Verification

### Connection Management
- ✅ Only one connection type active at a time
- ✅ Proper cleanup when switching connection modes
- ✅ Thread-safe operations with lock objects
- ✅ Event-driven communication between components

### TCP Server Features
- ✅ Accepts multiple concurrent client connections
- ✅ Each client handled in separate async task
- ✅ Proper JSON message parsing with error handling
- ✅ Graceful client disconnection handling
- ✅ Server shutdown stops all clients cleanly

### Error Handling
- ✅ Invalid JSON responses with error messages
- ✅ Unknown commands return proper error responses
- ✅ Network errors handled gracefully
- ✅ Plugin exceptions don't crash Rhino

### Performance Considerations
- ✅ Async/await pattern for non-blocking operations
- ✅ Efficient client collection management
- ✅ Proper resource disposal and cleanup
- ✅ Configurable timeouts and buffer sizes

## Next Steps

With Phase 1 complete, the foundation is solid for implementing:

1. **Phase 2: Extended MCP Commands**
   - Scene information and object queries
   - Viewport capture functionality
   - Python code execution
   - Object manipulation commands

2. **Phase 3: Remote WebSocket Client**
   - WebSocket client implementation for cloud connections
   - Authentication and token management
   - Bidirectional communication with remote MCP servers

3. **Phase 4: UI and Configuration**
   - Settings dialog for connection configuration
   - Status bar integration
   - Advanced debugging and logging options

The current implementation provides a robust, production-ready TCP server that can handle real MCP client connections and serves as the foundation for the complete MCP plugin ecosystem.
